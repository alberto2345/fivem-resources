WIP Dimensions/Virtual Worlds system for FiveM.

Main use case is for interiors.
Doesn't 100% work properly.
Doesn't have all the nessecary features such as working exports and other important things, but feel free to play around with it.

The way it works is it disables collisions and sets the alpha to 0 of all players that arent in the same dimension.
Anyone not in dimension 0 (main dimension), firing is disabled.
Objects, peds, vehicles, basically everything else that isn't a player are not affected by this system.
